    <br><strong>Count Czapski's Minsk</strong> <em>is a trip around some places related to a great
    Minsker, count Karal Huten-Czapski (1860-1904).
    He originated from a nobel rich family of Huten-Czapskis with old german roots, studied in
    Petersburg and Germany, spoke polish,
    but he became a passionate of Minsk, devoting his life to the city at the post of city's governer.
    Thankful to him Minsk arised, being a deep province for a long time before.
    At the period of his governing electric lights apeared here as well as municipal transport, homeless
    shelters, charitable pawnshops, cycling tracks with bike rental in the city park;
    the urban water supply system became more perfect and they already created the project of the urban
    sewerage for Czapski's own money, while he was dreaming about the schools accessible for all the
    children...
    We could list Czapski's deals for a long time, not missing the fact he owned the oldiest Minsk
    brewery that survived,
    also we could talk a lot about nice places of Minsk related to the hero but... don't you think it's
    better to go for that trip once?</em>
