                    <br><strong>"Minsk's hippies"</strong> <em>is a tour into the hairy and liberated 60-ties and
                    70-ties. Minsk's youth listened to the new kind of music by the western radio-waves (that were
                    muffeled by KGB).
                    They were dreaming to play like
                    "Beatles" and "Led Zeppelin". Of course, they didn't manage so...
                    That was a time when Minsk's bands appeared, unique and distinctive ones, mixing modern rock rymthes
                    with belarusian traditional music...
                    This is a travelling around the places of glory and drama of minsk's rock'n'roll.
                    Put on your old shoes and jeans, flower children are coming back in the city!</em>
