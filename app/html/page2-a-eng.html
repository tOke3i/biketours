<strong>Sightseeing (Minsk's best) tour</strong> <em>
	This is a trip around the most beautiful,
interesting and bright points of Minsk (" Miensk " before).
The most significant monuments,
persons and legends of our city are in one trip. The city of eclectic mixture will meet you,
where the spires of the old town are towering to the sky together with the modern office blocks,
where old private houses' time-blackened wooden walls
are standing side by side with soviet palaces' marble, where Baroque's soft and warm lines
are in contrast with unapproachable and pompous Stalin's Empire style.
Mutilated in the past by wars and fires,
today our main city looks clear and nice. Wide avenues and calm streets,
giant squares and cosy yards, green parks will greet you and
tell you what happened here over the last thousand years.</em>
